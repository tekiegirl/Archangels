# Architecture Principles

## Architecture general

| Principle                         | Rational                                                     | Implications                                                 |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modular architecture              | Modular design enables components/services to be improved/replaced with ease. | Components/services can be tested/deployed with minimal business disruption. Improved availability and reliability. |
| Pattern based architecture        | Industry well recognised/proven pattern based architectures will improve re-usability | Less effort to build and maintain systems                    |
| Compliant with law and regulation | All solutions must be law-abiding and compile with rules and guidance from regulatory bodies | Rules of the road, just follow them!                         |

##  Automation

| Principle                                            | Rational                                                     | Implications                                                 |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automated process by default and manual by exception | Process automation will bring efficiencies                   | Automated and Optimised processes. Humans can focus on more value added tasks. |
| Engineering Automation from start                    | Independently testable and deployable components using CI pipelines will improve reliability. | Reliability built into software means reduced time-to-market in later iterations. |

## Data

| Principle              | Rational                                                     | Implications                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data is valuable asset | In current era data collected/managed across systems in organisation can be harvested to maximise business benefit. | Business can evolve, adapt based on insights from the data. It covers current and historical data for all objects like customer, product, sales, staff, tickets and feedback. |
| Access to the data     | system components, humans require access to the data time-to-time. | Data democratisation using appropriate governance and controls will reduce the risk of data loss or need for data replication. |

## Integration

| Principle                                        | Rational                                | Implications                                                 |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Inter and intra system integration through API's | Services/components need to communicate | Standards based Information exchange across enterprise will benefit organisations. |

## Security

| Principle         | Rational                                                     | Implications                                      |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Secure from Start | Security is not a after thought. Security built into system and process design will provides more security for valuable business data. | Secured and protected organisation in digital era |

## Extend-ability and Maintain-ability

| Principle                     | Rational                                                     | Implications                                |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| System should be extendable   | New functionality will be required to support system evolution. | can support changing business needs.        |
| System should be Maintainable | Regular maintenance activities, fixing bugs are essential for any operational system. Will be able to perform change reliably and effectively | Least business disruption during the change |
